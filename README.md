Show Me Stainless Team Management (Designed and build in 2 week sprint)

This application was created to help a local business that fills jobs for commercial construction vendors.
By allowing subcontractors to create profiles, (or the admin to add them) the owner has a record of all contacts in their network along with pertinent data such as, phone number, email and certifications. The vendors themselves are treated in the same way, save they have the ability to post jobs to the system.

The owner can send automated messages to any and all contacts in the database through the app menu after login.
This message contains job details and a start date, as well as a link to either accept or reject the offer of consideration for a given job. This solves the problem of spending hours on the phone, taking nots on who is qualified for what, who is available etc.

Jobs themselves are also tracked along with all subcontractors currently working them.

As it stands the application is being converted to be mobile responsive, and many features are in the works as I test and take in feedback from the owner.

This version uses React, Redux, Express, Passport, and PostgreSQL (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).
